# EX0
Demonstration of RGB LED and Serial communication

# EX1
Servo with attach / detach

# EX2
Ultrasound sensor

# EX3
Ultrasound sensor activates a servo and uses Serial

# EX4
Drives two motors

# EX5
Sets functions to move two motors together

# EX6
Ultrasound sensor activates a servo and uses Serial


# EX7
Features two motors with an ultrasound sensor and a servo. The function is basically like a roomba robot. It goes ahead, turns a bit if it sees an obstacle far away but goes backward and activates the servo if there is an obstacle very close.



# EX8
Using a softAP it serves a set of pages and Over The Air Updates



# EX9
Using the WIFImanager, it has the autoconnect function to switch from Access Point to STATION. It also serves statically all pages hosted in the SPIFFS
